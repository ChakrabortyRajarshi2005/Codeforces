A. Odd One Out
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given three digits a
, b
, c
. Two of them are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Find the value that occurs exactly once.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤270
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a
, b
, c
 (0≤a
, b
, c≤9
). Two of the digits are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Output
For each test case, output the value that occurs exactly once.
