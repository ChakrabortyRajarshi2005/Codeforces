N. Fixing the Expression
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes
An expression is a string consisting of three characters, where the first and the last characters are digits (from 0
 to 9
), and the middle character is a comparison symbol (<, = or >).

An expression is true if the comparison symbol matches the digits (for example, if the first digit is strictly less than the last digit, the comparison symbol should be <).

For example, the expressions 1<3, 4>2, 0=0 are true, while 5>5, 7<3 are not.

You are given a string s
, which is an expression. Change as few characters as possible so that s
 becomes a true expression. Note that if s
 is already true, you should leave it as it is.

Input
The first line contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤300
) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing the string s
 (|s|=3
, the first and the last characters of s
 are digits, the second character is a comparison symbol).

Output
For each test case, print a string consisting of 3
 characters — a true expression which can be obtained by changing as few characters as possible in s
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
