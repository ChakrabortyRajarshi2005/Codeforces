C. Maximum Even Sum
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given two integers a
 and b
. You are to perform the following procedure:

First, you choose an integer k
 such that b
 is divisible by k
. Then, you simultaneously multiply a
 by k
 and divide b
 by k
.

Find the greatest possible even value of a+b
. If it is impossible to make a+b
 even, output −1
 instead.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers a
 and b
 (1≤a,b≤a⋅b≤1018)
.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum even value of a+b
 on a new line.

Note
In the first test case, it can be shown it is impossible for a+b
 to be even.

In the second test case, the optimal k
 is 2
. The sum is 2+4=6
.



import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b,a = map(int,input().split())
    sol = -1
    if (a + b) & 1 == 0: sol = a + b
    if a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1: sol = max(sol, a * b + 1)
    elif a % 2 == 0 and (a % 4 == 0 or b % 2 == 0): sol = max(sol, 2 + (a * b) // 2)
    print(sol)
