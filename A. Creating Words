A. Creating Words
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Matthew is given two strings a
 and b
, both of length 3
. He thinks it's particularly funny to create two new words by swapping the first character of a
 with the first character of b
. He wants you to output a
 and b
 after the swap.

Note that the new words may not necessarily be different.

Input
The first line contains t
 (1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, a
 and b
, both of length 3
. The strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

Output
For each test case, after the swap, output a
 and b
, separated by a space.
