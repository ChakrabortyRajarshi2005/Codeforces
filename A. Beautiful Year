It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

Input
The single line contains integer y (1000 ≤ y ≤ 9000) — the year number.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

                break;

        }
    }

        String yearStr = String.valueOf(year);
        for (int i = 0; i < yearStr.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < yearStr.length(); j++) {
                if (yearStr.charAt(i) == yearStr.charAt(j)) {
                    return false;
                }
