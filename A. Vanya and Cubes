A. Vanya and Cubes
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Vanya got n cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist of 1 + 2 = 3 cubes, the third level must have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cubes, and so on. Thus, the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1 + 2 + ... + (i - 1) + i cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104) — the number of cubes given to Vanya.

Output
Print the maximum possible height of the pyramid in the single line.

Illustration to the second sample:



import java.util.Scanner;

public class VanyaAndCubes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int height = 0, totalCubes = 0, currentLevel = 1;

        while (totalCubes + currentLevel <= n) {
            totalCubes += currentLevel;
            height++;
            currentLevel += height + 1;
        }

        System.out.println(height);
    }
}
